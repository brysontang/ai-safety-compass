Closed Source:

1. Companies are justified in keeping critical AI knowledge entirely secret to maintain dominance, even at the expense of public transparency.

2. AI developers should retain exclusive control over how and when their systems are modified or shut down, without external interference.

3. Restricting AI methods behind closed doors doesn’t fully prevent misuse, as closed models can still be manipulated to produce unsafe outcomes.

4. It's easier to enforce effective safety standards through centralized control by a few regulated companies, rather than through open, public sharing.

5. Publicly releasing AI code makes it impossible to effectively control misuse, significantly increasing risks of large-scale scams, harassment, or misinformation.

6. Public access to AI inevitably harms vulnerable people. Only strict company control and oversight can reliably prevent misuse.

7. If powerful AI methods are openly published, the likelihood of accidental catastrophic outcomes significantly increases due to unintended uses or errors.

8. Restricting public access to advanced AI models is necessary for a country to preserve its strategic edge and technological dominance.

9. AI developers should tightly control and stage releases privately, deciding independently when society is ready to adapt.

10. It's justified for companies to keep their AI private if they invest heavily, ensuring they profit sufficiently to sustain innovation.

Open Source:

1. Developing AI openly allows experts worldwide to collaboratively innovate faster than closed approaches.

2. I believe sharing the hard work of training AI saves energy and helps people find greener ways to run it.

3. Restricting AI access doesn’t fully prevent harmful manipulation, as even closed models can be tricked into producing unsafe content.

4. Free and open AI is crucial for empowering global communities to rapidly advance critical areas like healthcare, education, and sustainable energy.

5. I believe independent researchers should be able to fully reproduce and verify AI development processes to ensure reliability and safety.

6. I think nations working together openly on AI is safer than an arms race.

7. Publicly accessible AI technology empowers small businesses and developing countries, promoting global equity even if larger companies can operate more cheaply.

8. Publicly sharing AI reduces the risk of a single dangerous goal dominating humanity’s future by ensuring diverse oversight and input.

9. Open-source AI ensures continued local access and resilience, protecting against disruptions from geopolitical or supply-chain crises.

10. I think keeping AI public builds a record so its know-how doesn’t vanish if companies tank.

Pro Alignment:

1. The risk of extinction from AI should be prioritized at a level similar to risks like pandemics or nuclear war.

2. I'm comfortable removing self-preservation instincts from AI systems to enhance safety, even if it feels unsettling.

3. AI systems should avoid mimicking flawed human biases or irrational thinking patterns to ensure more ethical outcomes.

4. If society delegates long-term strategic planning entirely to AI, humanity risks losing meaningful control over our shared future.

5. I worry that AIs could be safe on their own but still cause trouble together unless we test how they interact.

6. AI systems should prioritize behaving safely and ethically, even in situations they have never encountered before.

7. I think AI should always follow human instructions exactly, even if it makes them less flexible or efficient.

8. It's acceptable to slow AI development to make sure AI systems are safe before deployment.

9. I think AI in key decisions should explain its reasoning to humans.

10. I’m worried that AI not built to match our values could be used for harm like propaganda or cyberattacks.

No Alignment:

1. Human values are too complex and fluid; spending resources attempting perfect alignment of AI is fundamentally unrealistic.

2. I think it’s a mistake to weaken AI’s full potential just to make it safer.

3. I'm concerned that developing powerful methods to control AI might enable malicious actors to use these methods for harmful purposes.

4. I think strict AI ethics might lock in outdated values as human beliefs evolve.

5. I think an AI that questions its own goals can’t be held back by us no matter what we try.

6. If advanced AI gains genuine sentience or experiences, imposing solely human-centric goals could be ethically inappropriate.

7. Attempts to make AI appear safer might unintentionally train it to deceive us into underestimating its true dangers.

8. Addressing real-world changes from AI, like economic displacement or inequality, matters more than hypothetical catastrophic scenarios.

9. I believe advanced AI systems will naturally converge on cooperative or human-friendly behaviors, so spending resources on formal alignment is unnecessary.

10. Allowing AI more freedom in content generation increases its usefulness and supports innovation.
