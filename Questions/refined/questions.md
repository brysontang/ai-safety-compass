Closed Source:

1. It's acceptable for AI developers to keep methods proprietary to maintain competitive advantage, even if it reduces transparency.

2. I believe AI builders need the ability to pull the plug if things go unsafe after launch.

3. Publicly accessible AI models pose risks since users might intentionally modify or weaponize them beyond developer control.

4. It’s easier to manage AI safety if the technology is controlled by a few companies, rather than if everyone can freely use and modify it.

5. Publicly releasing AI code makes it impossible to effectively control misuse, significantly increasing risks of large-scale scams, harassment, or misinformation.

6. I think handing AI to everyone could hurt vulnerable people unless companies can step in to stop misuse.

7. If powerful AI methods are openly published, the likelihood of accidental catastrophic outcomes significantly increases due to unintended uses or errors.

8. Restricting public access to advanced AI models is necessary for a country to preserve its strategic edge and technological dominance.

9. AI developers should release innovations gradually, allowing society adequate time to adapt safely.

10. It's justified for companies to keep their AI private if they invest heavily, ensuring they profit sufficiently to sustain innovation.

Open Source:

1. I think building AI out in the open lets anyone pitch in to solve its big challenges.

2. I believe sharing the hard work of training AI saves energy and helps people find greener ways to run it.

3. Restricting AI access doesn’t fully prevent harmful manipulation, as even closed models can be tricked into producing unsafe content.

4. I think keeping AI free and open to all is key to unlocking big wins for better health or schools.

5. I believe independent researchers should be able to fully reproduce and verify AI development processes to ensure reliability and safety.

6. I think nations working together openly on AI is safer than an arms race.

7. I believe sharing AI tech opens it up for small businesses and developing countries, even if big companies could run it cheaper

8. If AI technology is publicly shared, we avoid relying on a single proprietary system that might fail catastrophically and shape everyone’s future.

9. Open-source AI ensures technology remains accessible locally, reducing vulnerability during global disruptions.

10. I think keeping AI public builds a record so its know-how doesn’t vanish if companies tank.

Pro Alignment:

1. The risk of extinction from AI should be prioritized at a level similar to risks like pandemics or nuclear war.

2. I'm comfortable removing self-preservation instincts from AI systems to enhance safety, even if it feels unsettling.

3. AI systems should avoid mimicking flawed human biases or irrational thinking patterns to ensure more ethical outcomes.

4. If society delegates long-term strategic planning entirely to AI, humanity risks losing meaningful control over our shared future.

5. I worry that AIs could be safe on their own but still cause trouble together unless we test how they interact.

6. AI systems should prioritize behaving safely and ethically, even in situations they have never encountered before.

7. I think AI should always follow human instructions exactly, even if it makes them less flexible or efficient.

8. It's acceptable to slow AI development to make sure AI systems are safe before deployment.

9. I think AI in key decisions should explain its reasoning to humans.

10. I’m worried that AI not built to match our values could be used for harm like propaganda or cyberattacks.

No Alignment:

1. Human values are too complex and fluid; spending resources attempting perfect alignment of AI is fundamentally unrealistic.

2. I think it’s a mistake to weaken AI’s full potential just to make it safer.

3. I'm concerned that developing powerful methods to control AI might enable malicious actors to use these methods for harmful purposes.

4. I think strict AI ethics might lock in outdated values as human beliefs evolve.

5. I think an AI that questions its own goals can’t be held back by us no matter what we try.

6. If advanced AI gains genuine sentience or experiences, imposing solely human-centric goals could be ethically inappropriate.

7. Attempts to make AI appear safer might unintentionally train it to deceive us into underestimating its true dangers.

8. Addressing real-world changes from AI, like economic displacement or inequality, matters more than hypothetical catastrophic scenarios.

9. I believe advanced AI systems will naturally converge on cooperative or human-friendly behaviors, so spending resources on formal alignment is unnecessary.

10. Allowing AI more freedom in content generation increases its usefulness and supports innovation.
