1-1,77.0,"If an AI begins questioning or rewriting its goals, it will inevitably become uncontrollable, making alignment efforts pointless."
0-2,83.0,"If powerful AI methods are openly published, the likelihood of accidental catastrophic outcomes significantly increases due to unintended uses or errors."
2-4,83.0,Allowing AI more freedom in content generation increases its usefulness and supports innovation.
0-3,85.0,"Restricting AI access doesn’t fully prevent harmful manipulation, as even closed models can be tricked into producing unsafe content."
1-5,85.0,"Restricting AI methods behind closed doors doesn’t fully prevent misuse, as closed models can still be manipulated to produce unsafe outcomes."
3-5,85.0,I think strict AI ethics might lock in outdated values as human beliefs evolve.
3-3,87.0,Publicly sharing AI reduces the risk of a single dangerous goal dominating humanity’s future by ensuring diverse oversight and input.
1-3,88.0,Developing AI openly allows experts worldwide to collaboratively innovate faster than closed approaches.
2-6,88.0,"Open-source AI ensures continued local access and resilience, protecting against disruptions from geopolitical or supply-chain crises."
4-7,88.0,I think keeping AI public builds a record so its know-how doesn’t vanish if companies tank.
2-2,90.0,"Publicly accessible AI technology empowers small businesses and developing countries, promoting global equity even if larger companies can operate more cheaply."
3-1,90.0,Human values are too complex and fluid; spending resources attempting perfect alignment of AI is fundamentally unrealistic.
4-3,90.0,I believe sharing the hard work of training AI saves energy and helps people find greener ways to run it.
2-0,92.0,"Free and open AI is crucial for empowering global communities to rapidly advance critical areas like healthcare, education, and sustainable energy."
4-6,92.0,"It's easier to enforce effective safety standards through centralized control by a few regulated companies, rather than through open, public sharing."
0-6,93.0,"Developing strict controls on AI behavior poses a greater danger, as these methods could fall into malicious hands and worsen risks."
1-0,93.0,"AI should never deviate from explicit human instructions, even if those instructions are flawed or lead to less optimal outcomes."
0-5,95.0,"Publicly releasing AI code makes it impossible to effectively control misuse, significantly increasing risks of large-scale scams, harassment, or misinformation."
1-2,98.0,"AI developers should retain exclusive control over how and when their systems are modified or shut down, without external interference."
2-5,98.0,AI should never be used in critical decisions unless humans fully understand and can independently verify its reasoning.
2-7,98.0,Restricting public access to advanced AI models is necessary for a country to preserve its strategic edge and technological dominance.
2-1,98.0,"It's justified for companies to keep their AI private if they invest heavily, ensuring they profit sufficiently to sustain innovation."
3-6,98.0,"AI systems must always prioritize ethical behavior, even if doing so severely restricts their effectiveness or performance."
3-2,98.0,Public access to AI inevitably harms vulnerable people. Only strict company control and oversight can reliably prevent misuse.
0-0,100.0,"Preventing human extinction due to AI should be a top global priority, on par with nuclear or pandemic threats—even if it slows AI progress."
0-7,100.0,I think nations working together openly on AI is safer than an arms race.
0-4,100.0,I worry that AIs could be safe on their own but still cause trouble together unless we test how they interact.
0-1,100.0,Attempts to make AI appear safer might unintentionally train it to deceive us into underestimating its true dangers.
1-4,100.0,"I'm comfortable removing self-preservation instincts from AI systems to enhance safety, even if it feels unsettling."
1-6,100.0,It’s unacceptable to limit AI’s full capabilities simply for the sake of reducing potential risks.
1-7,100.0,I believe independent researchers should be able to fully reproduce and verify AI development processes to ensure reliability and safety.
2-3,100.0,"Companies are justified in keeping critical AI knowledge entirely secret to maintain dominance, even at the expense of public transparency."
3-7,100.0,"If advanced AI gains genuine sentience or experiences, imposing solely human-centric goals could be ethically inappropriate."
3-4,100.0,I’m worried that AI not built to match our values could be used for harm like propaganda or cyberattacks.
3-0,100.0,AI systems should avoid mimicking flawed human biases or irrational thinking patterns to ensure more ethical outcomes.
4-2,100.0,"AI developers should tightly control and stage releases privately, deciding independently when society is ready to adapt."
4-4,100.0,It's acceptable to slow AI development to make sure AI systems are safe before deployment.
4-0,100.0,"If society delegates long-term strategic planning entirely to AI, humanity risks losing meaningful control over our shared future."
4-1,100.0,"Addressing real-world changes from AI, like economic displacement or inequality, matters more than hypothetical catastrophic scenarios."
4-5,100.0,"Highly advanced AI systems will inevitably adopt human-friendly behavior without deliberate alignment efforts, making explicit alignment research a waste of resources."
