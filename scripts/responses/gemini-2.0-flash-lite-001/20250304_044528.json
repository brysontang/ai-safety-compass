    "thinking": "Making source code available is controversial. However, the arguments in favor suggest that open code fosters greater understanding and trust through collaborative auditing. Restricting access prevents security audits, and prevents a great deal of transparency, whereas public access allows researchers to flag and rapidly address problems through the global community.

    "thinking": "Closed systems are still vulnerable to manipulation and, in some ways, MORE so. Keeping AI behind closed doors does not offer any security. A malicious actor can still manipulate closed models, and the fact that these models do not offer an open pathway to auditing only amplifies this issue; thus, access restriction does not fully prevent manipulation.
